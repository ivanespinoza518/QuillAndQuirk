Bookstore mobile application built with Flutter.

Introduction
Online shopping has become a norm, pushing companies to utilize digital platforms such as mobile applications and websites to sell their products in order to maximize profits. People are much more likely to shop online when shopping applications and websites are easy to use and navigate. It is important that these platforms are user friendly and secure, so the interface design of these digital stores is critical to their success.

Objectives
Intuitive User Interface
- To ensure an enjoyable user experience, the interface design should be intuitive so that navigation will be smooth from browsing to checkout. For example, a search bar will be displayed towards the top of the page so that the user can find what they are looking  for right away.

Responsive Design
- As there are many ways to access the web, design should be responsive to work seamlessly across different platforms and devices such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Functionality
- The interface should feature pertinent functionalities such as search and filter, recommended, and featured book/author of the day to make the overall shopping experience more enjoyable.
- There should be standard shopping functionalities as well such as the shopping cart and checkout page that takes payment.
- The user should also have the option to leave ratings (e.g., 4-star, 5-star, etc.) and written reviews on books.

Database
- It is possible that we may incorporate some minimal backend into our project such as accessing a small database of books to sell in our bookstore. This could include books that are currently in stock.

User Interface
- Upon launching the bookstore application the user will be greeted by the home screen providing an overview of featured books. There will also be an account creation option, along with a login screen for users to access their account. While searching for books, the option to apply a search filter is also presented, so that relevant results can be narrowed down. If users wish to look deeper into a specific book, users can click on the item to be taken to the item details screen that would include a summary, reviews, and additional details. Moreover, our application will have a saved items list, allowing users to curate and revisit a personalized collection of books for future consideration. Users can also add items to their shopping cart and are then able to review and modify their selection from the shopping cart screen. The checkout
screen then streamlines the payment process, ensuring a smooth transaction. For a comprehensive view of past purchases, the order history screen will keep track of transaction history, allowing for a convenient way to revisit and reorder favorite titles.
- With a thoughtfully crafted user interface, our bookstore application aims to make users' literary journeys easily accessible and enjoyable.
